# MNIST-ML-Project-
This project classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Keras deep learning model. It preprocesses data, visualizes samples, builds a Sequential model with Dense and ReLU layers, and evaluates performance using accuracy and confusion matrix. Custom images can also be predicted using the trained model.
